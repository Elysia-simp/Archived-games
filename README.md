As stated this is a github that will be full of games I archived/made downloaders for before shut down

# NOTICE

These assets are still regarded undercopyright of their respective owners, Please treat them with respect!

In other words, Do not do what you wouldn't do if these games were active update still!

# Submissions

All submissions are welcomed and will be handled via Discord(Chi#4089) as I'd obviously need time to screen the files provided to ensure they meet the following


A) Complete dump (or as close to complete as we can get)

B) Actually shut down*

C) A active update game


I don't particularly care if they have an encryption or not, Archival above convenience.

(*If the game is a global release I won't consider it EOL, Original server needs to shut down too, There are also cases of Asset Servers staying up for extended periods after shut down)
